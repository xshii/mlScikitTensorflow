# content
## Part I,  e Fundamentals of Machine Learning
Linear and Polynomial Regression, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Ensemble methods.

## Part II, Neural Networks and Deep Learning
feedforward neural nets, convolutional nets, recurrent nets, long short-term memory (LSTM) nets, and autoencoders.

# Other Materials
 * Joel Grus, *Data Science from Scratch* (Oâ€™Reilly). This book presents the fundamentals of Machine Learning, and implements some of the main algorithms in pure Python (from scratch, as the name suggests).
 * Stephen Marsland, *Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective* (Chapman and Hall). This book is a great introduction to Machine Learning, covering a wide range of topics in depth, with code examples in Python (also from scratch, but using NumPy).
 * Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 3rd Edition* (Pearson). This is a great (and huge) book covering an incredible amount of topics, including Machine Learning. It helps put ML into perspective.
